# CodeGenerator
password generator
I've wrote out code of javascript. The code allows for the user to use the website. 
So when the user clicks on the "generate password" they get a pop up on the screen asking 
"How long do they want thier password?" after this question it will Continuously ask question
until it reaches the last question "Do you want numbers?"
Then after answering the questions it will generate a password on the webpage.
